  "description": "Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was \"Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?\". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.",
